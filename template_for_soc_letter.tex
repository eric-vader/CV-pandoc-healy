Dear Associate Professor Prateek Saxena, \\[1em]
\hfill\begin{minipage}[t]{0.95\textwidth}\justifying{\noindent
  I am writing to express my interest in the Educator Track Faculty Position in the Department Of Computer Science (NUS Portal Requisition ID: 24619).
  With a passion for Computer Science, a dedication to excellent teaching and many years benefitting as an undergraduate and graduate student in SoC,
  I am excited about the opportunity to contribute back to NUS and SoC.
  \\[.5em]
  Throughout my doctorate journey, I have been teaching undergraduate Computer Science classes spanning across AI/ML and Software Engineering as a `Graduate Tutor' and `Teaching Assistant'.
  I am currently `Teaching Assistant', with more than 5 years of experience (with more than 500 teaching/contact hours) in teaching lectures, tutorials, and consultations.
  This role has not only allowed me to refine my communication skills but also to play a pivotal part in educating and inspiring the next generation of computer scientists.
  My responsibilities extended beyond classroom instruction to include the management and mentorship of undergraduate tutors, 
  developing grading rubrics, exam questions, and module tools.
  In recognition of my dedication to teaching excellence and my ability to effectively convey complex concepts, 
  I was honored with the Full-Time Teaching Assistant Award in 2023. 
  I am committed to teaching excellence and possess the necessary teaching experience for this position.
  \\[.5em]
  My doctoral research is primarily in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), specifically focusing on developing advanced techniques to mitigate the challenges inherent in Bayesian Optimization - including high-dimensionality, large datasets, and enhancing robustness. I presented my research and have first-author publications in premier conferences, such as AAAI and ICML. I have more than 5 years of formal research experience in Computer Science.
  \\[.5em]
  Enclosed is my curriculum vitae, teaching statement, research statement which provides additional details about my background and qualifications.
  I am grateful for your consideration of my application.
}\end{minipage}\\[1em]

Warm regards,\\
Eric Han\\
