Dear Sir/Mdm, \\[1em]
\hfill\begin{minipage}[t]{0.95\textwidth}\justifying{\noindent
  I am writing to express my interest in the `Senior Decision Support Data Scientist' position as recommended by Carissa Huang.
  Carissa and I are close friends and have known each other at Church for more than 10 years, growing up together in the same cell group.
  Her insight into personal and professional aspirations, 
  especially with my recent completion of a PhD in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore, 
  prompted her to recommend Apple as an ideal place to start my post-doctoral career.
  Carissa's positive reflections on Apple's work environment, and after finding out more about the role, I have decided to apply.
  \\[.5em]
  During my doctoral research,
  I specialized in the field of optimization, with a particular focus on developing advanced techniques to mitigate the challenges inherent in Bayesian Optimization - including high-dimensionality, large datasets, and enhancing robustness. This research allowed me to gain substantial hands-on experience in formulating and implementing complex AI/ML projects.
  The projects are written in the Python programming language and leverage a wide array of machine learning and data visualization libraries such as SciPy, NumPy, PyTorch, Plotly, matplotlib. 
  My approach to algorithm design often incorporated sophisticated data structures, such as the Union-Find algorithm, to enhance efficiency and performance significantly.
  I presented my research and have first-author publications in the premier conferences AAAI and ICML.
  \\[.5em]
  Throughout my doctorate journey, I have been teaching undergraduate Computer Science classes spanning across AI/ML and Software Engineering.
  This role has not only allowed me to refine my communication skills but also to play a pivotal part in educating and inspiring the next generation of computer scientists.
  My responsibilities extended beyond classroom instruction to include the management and mentorship of undergraduate tutors, 
  further demonstrating my leadership capabilities and commitment to fostering a supportive learning environment.
  In recognition of my dedication to teaching excellence and my ability to effectively convey complex concepts, 
  I was honored with the Full-Time Teaching Assistant Award in 2023.
  \\[.5em]
  In addition to my academic pursuits, 
  I have enriched my professional experience through various internships and projects that have allowed me to apply my technical knowledge in real-world settings.
  A notable project is with Scanteak, where I was charged with using technology to enhance the quality control mechanisms within their supply chain. 
  My role entailed conducting multiple business trips to Scanteak's production facilities and distribution centers, 
  during which I meticulously analyzed their operations and implemented solutions to streamline operations and improve quality control.
  \\[.5em]
  I am grateful for your consideration of my application, as well as for the endorsement provided by Carissa.
  I look forward to an interview at your convenience.

Warm regards,\\
Eric Han\\
