Dear Sir/Mdm, \\[1em]
\hfill\begin{minipage}[t]{0.95\textwidth}\justifying{\noindent
  I am writing to express my interest in the `Assistant/Associate Professor' position in the `Department Of Computer Science'.
  With a passion for Computer Science and a dedication to excellent teaching, 
  I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to DigiPen.
  \\[.5em]
  My doctoral research is primarily in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), specifically focusing on developing advanced techniques to mitigate the challenges inherent in Bayesian Optimization - including high-dimensionality, large datasets, and enhancing robustness. I presented my research and have first-author publications in premier conferences, such as AAAI and ICML. I have more than 5 years of formal research experience in Computer Science.
  \\[.5em]
  Throughout my doctorate journey, I have been teaching undergraduate Computer Science classes spanning across AI/ML and Software Engineering.
  I am currently `Teaching Assistant', with more than 5 years of experience (with more than 500 teaching/contact hours) in teaching lectures, tutorials, and consultations.
  This role has not only allowed me to refine my communication skills but also to play a pivotal part in educating and inspiring the next generation of computer scientists.
  My responsibilities extended beyond classroom instruction to include the management and mentorship of undergraduate tutors, 
  developing grading rubrics, exam questions, and module tools.
  In recognition of my dedication to teaching excellence and my ability to effectively convey complex concepts, 
  I was honored with the Full-Time Teaching Assistant Award in 2023. 
  I am committed to teaching excellence and possess the necessary teaching experience for this position.
  \\[.5em]
  In addition to my academic pursuits, I have background in C++ programming; 
  I started learning C++ language formally while pursuing GCE `A' levels H2 Computing in Junior College.
  I continued learning C++ at University even though it was not the programming language of choice for AI/ML, getting an `A' for ITP-435x - `Professional C++' at the University of Southern California during my student exchange. Some of my personal/research projects are implemented in C++.
  I also have background in Distributed Computing, demonstrated by my various internships at Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Institute of High Performance Computing, Distributed Computing Group.
  Throughout my internships there, I worked with large datasets and implemented software that works over a cluster such as a distributed web crawler.
  During my PhD, I wrote software and used a distributed cluster (Slurm) to distribute experiments over a cluster of computers.
  \\[.5em]
  Enclosed is my curriculum vitae, statement of teaching philosophy, and PhD transcript which provides additional details about my background and qualifications.
  I am grateful for your consideration of my application.

Warm regards,\\
Eric Han\\
