Dear Ms. Tanisha, \\[1em]
\hfill\begin{minipage}[t]{0.95\textwidth}\justifying{\noindent
  Thank you for our conversation at ICML 2022 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
  \\[.5em]
  I am studying for a Ph.D. in AI/Machine Learning and am on track to graduation in \emph{Aug 2023}.
  I am interested in an internship at Citadel Securities, Singapore from \emph{November 14, 2022 - February 5, 2023}, spanning \emph{12 weeks}.
  \\[.5em]
  My research tackles problems in Gaussian Process optimization, such as high-dimensionality, large datasets, and robustness considerations.
  I have first-author publications in peer-reviewed premier conferences such as AAAI and ICML.
  I am interested in applying Artificial Intelligence, my research and programming skills to challenging problems in Citadel Securities, Singapore.
  \\[.5em]
  Apart from Artificial Intelligence research, I am also interested in digital assets. 
  I believe asset tokenization and blockchain technology will open new use cases in the finance industry.
  I am especially drawn to Citadel Securities, Singapore, due to its market-making activities in digital assets.
  I hope to be able to apply my skills specifically in that area.
  \\[.5em]
  Thank you for your consideration.
}\end{minipage}\\[1em]

Regards,\\
Eric Han\\
